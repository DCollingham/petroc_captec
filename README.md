## Year 2  Computing FdSc Coursework
### Database solution for the company Captec.<br>

A Group project where I took on the role of Developer.<br>

>The project outline is to provide a browser-based solution optimising the current system in place by the company Captec. Captec utilises a paper-based system to track the status of build-instructions. These build-instructions are utilised to build machines such as Desktops and Server racks. Due to client requirements, strict instructions must be followed on some builds, and thus these should not be changed by anyone unqualified.<br> 

#### Project Goals
*	Provide a simple layout.
*	Allow users to enter requests for document updates and the creation of new documents.
*	Provide a mechanism for accepting or rejecting requests.
*	Allow all members to view existing document information. <br><br>
